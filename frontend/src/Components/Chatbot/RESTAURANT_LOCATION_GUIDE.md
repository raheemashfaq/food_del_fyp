# 🏪 Restaurant Location Management System

## 🎯 You're Absolutely Right!

Yes, you understood correctly! The system needs to know **where the restaurant is located** to properly calculate delivery times and distances. I've now enhanced the system to properly manage restaurant location and provide clear delivery estimates.

## 🏪 Restaurant Location Configuration

### **Current Restaurant Setup:**
```javascript
const RESTAURANT_LOCATION = {
  name: "Tomato Food Restaurant",
  address: "Block A, Johar Town, Lahore", 
  lat: 31.582045,
  lng: 74.329376,
  area: "Johar Town"
};
```

## 📍 How Delivery Calculation Works

### **Distance-Based Delivery System:**

1. **Restaurant Location** (Fixed Point)
   - 📍 **Coordinates:** 31.582045, 74.329376
   - 🏢 **Area:** Johar Town, Lahore
   - 🏪 **Name:** Tomato Food Restaurant

2. **Customer Location** (Variable Point)
   - 🏠 User's delivery address
   - 📱 GPS location or saved address
   - 🗺️ Map-selected location

3. **Distance Calculation**
   - 📏 **Formula:** Haversine formula for accurate distance
   - ⏱️ **Base Time:** 15 minutes + 2 minutes per km
   - 🚚 **Range:** 20-45 minutes (realistic delivery window)

## 🎯 Enhanced Delivery Information

### **Detailed Delivery Response:**
```
User selects delivery location →

🏪 From: Tomato Food Restaurant
🏠 To: Home (or selected location)
📏 Distance: 3.2 km
🕰️ Estimated Time: 21 minutes

```

### **Restaurant Location Inquiry:**
```
User: "Where is restaurant located?"

🏪 Our Restaurant Location:

🏢 Name: Tomato Food Restaurant
📍 Address: Block A, Johar Town, Lahore
🏙️ Area: Johar Town

🚚 We deliver throughout Lahore from this location.
