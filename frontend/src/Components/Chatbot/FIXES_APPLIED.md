# 🤖 Chatbot Issues Fixed - Test Summary

## 🚨 Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **"Track my order" Response Issue**
**Problem**: "Track my order" was giving order placement response instead of order tracking
**Root Cause**: Duplicate and conflicting logic in backend controller
**Solution**: ✅ Removed duplicate sections and reorganized logic flow

### 2. **Order Intent Conflicts** 
**Problem**: "Track my order" was being caught by general "order" detection
**Solution**: ✅ Added proper exclusion logic: `!userMsg.includes("track") && !userMsg.includes("my order")`

### 3. **Authentication Flow**
**Problem**: User ID not properly passed for order tracking
**Solution**: ✅ Enhanced frontend to pass token as userId for authenticated users

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Fix

### **Track My Order**
